## About

If you want your tests to be isolated... you need mocks! And mocking GUI
stuff is hard. shoes-mocks to the rescue!

## ... but not just yet

This project is in the 'primordial-ooze' stage. See that 0.0.1? Yeah.
I'm serious. So! It's probably not useful to you yet. But don't let me
stop you! Just know that it's quite limited.

## Using it

Just require 'shoes/mocks' in your test helper, and put
'shoes-mocks' in your Gemfile. Easy as pie!
